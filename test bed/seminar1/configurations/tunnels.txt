so when your life was on the line and i was there every step of the 
way it meant nothing
you bailed out the second i wanted more
thats not moving on thats sticking a knife in my gut and tisting it

a man named santa claus climbs down chimneys to leave behind gifts
under trees

i will i just need to translate this from bullshit to english

that was the sound of your face hitting the canvas

I've been doing shit like this since you was an itch in your 
daddy's pants
